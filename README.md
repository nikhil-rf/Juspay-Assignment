📝 Design Decisions, Challenges & Improvements

Challenges Faced & Key Learnings

"During this assignment, I have tackled and learned many things. Before this, I used to code in a very simple way, but by this assignment, I have done research and got to know about new code writing practices and also to optimize my code as much as I can. I also learned new things about searching, sorting, filtering the data present in our website and also learned to implement clean and efficient UI."

Design Decisions

Vite: Chosen for its superior build performance and fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) compared to traditional bundlers.

Component Modularity: The application is structured into reusable components to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

Lucide React: Integrated for lightweight, consistent SVG icons that support dynamic styling (sizing and coloring based on themes).

Improvements Implemented

Refactored basic logic into optimized functions for data manipulation.

Implemented dynamic dark/light mode icon switching.

Enhanced user interaction with responsive navigation elements.
